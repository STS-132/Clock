 # HTML/CSS Clock
- Uses HTML and CSS - 
	   -Directions-

1.) In order to open the html file, make sure you have fully extracted the "Clocks" folder from the zip folder.

2.) Then, find a cozy, safe, permanent spot for the "Clocks" folder.

3.) Open the "Clocks" folder and get started and have fun looking at the time!
 

	*If you have good technical experience, you can create a bookmark on your local web browser (preferably 	
	Google Chrome), for quick access to the file. I say "find a permanent spot" because if the destination of 	
	the file(s) and/or folder(s) is changed, the bookmark will NOT open the file, and will come up with an error.
	So please, don't get mad and repeatedly smash your keyboard because a simple html file won't open.
	
		Again, have fun looking at the the time!
